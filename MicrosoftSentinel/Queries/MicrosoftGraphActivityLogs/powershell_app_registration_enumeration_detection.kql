// The Invoke-DumpApps module assists in identifying app registrations. It will dump a list of Azure app registrations from the tenant, 
// including permission scopes and users that have consented to the apps. Additionally, it will list external apps that are not owned by the current 
// tenant or by Microsoftâ€™s main app tenant. This is a way to find third-party external apps that users may have consented to. The execution of this module 
// results in a significant amount of events, as shown in the below screenshot.
