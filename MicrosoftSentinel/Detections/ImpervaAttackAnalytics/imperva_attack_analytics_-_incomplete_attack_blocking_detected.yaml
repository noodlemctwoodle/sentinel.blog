name: Imperva Attack Analytics  - Incomplete Attack Blocking Detected
description: This detection identifies and prioritises web application attacks that potentially bypassed Imperva WAF protections in the last 3 hours. It focuses on incidents where some attack traffic was NOT blocked (events_blocked_percent < 100%), indicating potential security gaps that require immediate attention.
